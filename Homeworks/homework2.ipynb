    "    * Imagine a vandal has torn the books into individual chapters, and left them in one large pile. How can we restore these disorganized chapters to their original books? This is a challenging problem since the individual chapters are unlabeled: we donâ€™t know what words might distinguish them into groups. \n",
    "        1. Partition the Bronte/Wells novels into their chapters (regular expressions)\n",
    "        2. Cluster the chapters into various number of groups and measure the association between author and cluster membership.\n",
    "2. Spell Checker\n",
    "    * The approach we took in class was maybe \"wasteful\": we first expand the word into a large set of *candidates* only to eliminate most of them immediately by comparing to a large corpus of existing words. Can you think of another approach and which one do you believe would be computationally cheaper?\n",
    "    * Peter Norvig generously provides code and data for the spell checker on his Web site (http://norvig.com/ngrams/).  How would you incorporate the probabilities of single-edit transitions which are given in the file *count_1edit.txt* ? Write pseudo code or a version of Bayes theorem which fits this situation. \n",
    "    * Think about the ever finer granularity that a \"great algorithm\" needs to model, such as dependency on user, device, language, keyboard layout, etc.."
